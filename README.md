# Izenda Mvc5Starterkit

## Overview
The MVC5 Starterkit showcases how to embed Izenda in a MVC5 application.

 :warning: The MVC Kit is designed for demonstration purposes and should not be used as an “as-is” fully-integrated solution. You can use the kit for reference or a baseline but ensure that security and customization meet the standards of your company.

## SQL Scripts

The MVC5Starterkit is pre-set to use locally installed instances of SQL LocalDB (mdf) for the Izenda database and the MVC5Starterkit database. You can configure the kit to use full-fledged sql server instances by following the instructions below.

### Creating the Izenda database
This is the database for the Izenda configuration. It contains report definitions, dashboards,etc.
- Create a database named 'IzendaMVC'. You may use any name of your choosing, just be sure to modify the script below to use the new database name.
- Download and execute the <a href="https://github.com/Izenda7Series/Mvc5StarterKit/blob/master/SQLScript/MSSQL/IzendaMvc.sql">IzendaMVC.sql</a> script.  
- Modify the <a  href="https://github.com/Izenda7Series/Mvc5StarterKit/blob/master/Mvc5StarterKit/Web.config">web.config (Line 86)</a> file with a valid connection string to this new database.

```xml
  <connectionStrings>
    <add name="DefaultConnection" connectionString="[your connection string here]" providerName="System.Data.SqlClient" />
  </connectionStrings>
``` 

### Creating the Mvc5StarterKit database
This is the database for the Mvc5 application. It contains the users, roles, tenants used to login.
- Create a database named 'Mvc5StarterKit'. You may use any name of your choosing, just be sure to modify the script below to use the new database name.
- Download the <a href="https://github.com/Izenda7Series/Mvc5StarterKit/blob/master/SQLScript/MSSQL/Mvc5StarterKit.sql">Mvc5StarterKit.sql</a> script.
- Modify the <a href="https://github.com/Izenda7Series/Mvc5StarterKit/blob/master/Mvc5StarterKit/izendadb.config">izendadb.config</a> file with a valid connection string to this new database.

```json
{"ServerTypeId":"572bd576-8c92-4901-ab2a-b16e38144813","ServerTypeName":"[MSSQL] SQLServer","ConnectionString":"[your connection string here]","ConnectionId":"00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"}
